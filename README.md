Step 1: Install Git
Ensure that Git is installed on your computer. You can download it from Git's official site if not already installed.

Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Provide a repository name, description (optional), and set it as public or private.
Click Create repository.
Step 3: Set Up the Project in VS Code
Open VS Code.
Create a folder for your project and place the provided HTML file inside it. Open this folder in VS Code.
File > Open Folder > Select your project folder.
Open a terminal in VS Code:
View > Terminal or press `Ctrl+``.
Initialize a Git repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
Step 4: Commit the Code
Stage the files for commit:
bash
Copy code
git add .
This adds all files in the folder to the staging area.
Commit the files:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added Fashion Store HTML code"
Step 5: Link the Local Repository to GitHub
Copy the repository URL from GitHub. It should look like this:
arduino
Copy code
https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Add this remote URL to your local repository:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Push the code to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Step 6: Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository page.
Refresh the page, and you should see your HTML code uploaded.
Optional: Use VS Code Git Integration
If you prefer a graphical interface:

Click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar of VS Code.
Stage changes by clicking the "+" icon next to the file name.
Add a commit message in the input field and click the checkmark.
Push changes by clicking on the "â€¦", then select Push.
Your project is now successfully pushed to GitHub! ðŸŽ‰
